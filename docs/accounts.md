# Lazy Account Directory

Available since `0.1.0-alpha.3`, `AccountDirectoryClient` adds lazy account loading
to the server. Older images do not include it. Use a dedicated, authorized
account: an authenticated HTTP query can now trigger login and, by default,
create a missing regional role. No new HTTP login endpoint is exposed.

## Configuration

Add these sections to a complete server configuration. The device context, SDK
HTTP configuration and state directory are described in [operations](operations.md).
The project does not distribute service AppKeys or device identifiers.

```toml
[login]
context_file = "secrets/device-context.json"
sdk_http_file = "secrets/sdk-http.json"
state_dir = "secrets/state"

[accounts]
directory = "/accounts"
# selected = "worker.json"
allow_create = true
sdk_ready = true
```

Each account is one UTF-8 JSON file, with exactly these fields:

```json
{"user":"worker@example.invalid","password":"OPERATOR_PASSWORD"}
```

`user` is the SDK email login, not a game nickname, player ID or SDK UID. These are
placeholders, not usable credentials. Create files with a private editor or secret
manager; do not place real passwords in shell arguments/history, images or Git.
The loader does not write or modify account files. It zeroizes owned password
buffers on drop on a best-effort basis.

- Enable directory login explicitly with `[accounts]`; its default path is
  `/accounts`. Without this section, existing static/managed login is unchanged.
- One instance serves **one selected account and one configured region**. One
  visible `.json` file is selected automatically. Multiple files require `selected`
  to name one basename; there is no account rotation or load balancing.
- Account files must be regular, non-symlink files, at most 64 KiB, mode 0600 or
  stricter. Unknown/duplicate JSON fields, empty values and unsafe names fail closed.
  Username/password limits are 1024/4096 UTF-8 bytes. Directory mode is 0700 or
  stricter. Protect parent paths too; login/persistence requires Unix.
- Auto-selection scans at most 128 directory entries, including non-JSON files.
  Explicit selection reads only the selected file. A missing directory/file or
  empty directory leaves authentication unloaded; it does not stop the process.
- `allow_create` defaults to **true**. Set it to false to reject missing roles.
  `sdk_ready` defaults to false; true asserts that required SDK consent and
  post-login checks have been completed. This does not bypass challenges, OTP,
  consent, account recovery or other official-client requirements.

Mount `/accounts` read-only, with owner-only access for container UID/GID 65532.
Mount `login.state_dir` read-write with the same owner and mode 0700. In addition
to the configuration mount, a source-built container can use:

```sh
--mount type=bind,src=/absolute/accounts,dst=/accounts,readonly \
--mount type=bind,src=/absolute/state,dst=/var/lib/moenotes
```

Set `login.state_dir = "/var/lib/moenotes"` in that deployment. Sessions for
different region/origin/account combinations get separate `account-<digest>`
subdirectories. This digest is a namespace, not encryption. Root-level manual
CLI snapshots are not silently imported into an account directory's state.

## Lifecycle

1. Startup, `check-config`, `auth-status`, `/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`,
   `/v1/status` and anonymous queries do not read account passwords or log in.
   `check-config` validates server/login settings, not account-file contents.
   Health always returns 200 for a running process; readiness remains 503 until
   an authenticated query succeeds or game-session recovery completes.
2. The first valid, bearer-authorized query requiring game authentication starts
   one background load. The triggering request returns 503, as do protected
   queries while loading; it is **not replayed**. Retry after loading completes.
3. A saved session in the selected scope is loaded locally, without SDK calls,
   pre-login or role creation. This does not prove the saved token is still valid.
4. Without saved state, after `sdk_ready=true`, send one SDK RSA request and at
   most one password request. Persist the returned SDK authorization privately,
   then call `PlayerPreLogin` for the configured region.
5. If a role exists, log in normally. If none exists, proceed only when
   `allow_create=true`; `PlayerLogin` performs first-role creation. Errors or
   maintenance responses are never interpreted as missing roles. Pre-login and
   login are separate calls, not a transactional no-creation guarantee.
6. Persist game/SDK snapshots and atomically publish `current.json`. Future
   requests use that session. Cache generations change; stale results cannot
   cross the session boundary. No naming/tutorial/reward/gameplay calls are made.

There is no login on startup, health probing, timer or directory watcher. Adding a
file enables loading on the next protected query. Failed initialization is limited
to one attempt per input revision in a process; unchanged inputs do not loop.
Fixing malformed files or changing credentials permits another attempt. An
initialized/pinned username cannot silently switch when a file is replaced.
Upstream authentication, version or device blocks are not cleared by file changes;
they require explicit operator action and reload.

The initialization deadline is 120 seconds. Cancellation cannot undo a login
already sent upstream. A failure after in-memory session rotation blocks protected
queries until operator reload; an unpersisted login is not treated as ready.

## Reload and Recovery

In accounts mode, **SIGHUP clears the in-memory session and rearms lazy loading**.
The signal itself performs no network call. A subsequent protected query selects
the account again and prefers its saved session. SIGHUP is refused while login or
recovery runs. Configuration changes, including `selected`, need a process restart.
State must be kept on a persistent volume to avoid re-login after container removal.

With `recovery.enabled=true`, rejected game credentials use the selected scope's
approved SDK snapshot for existing-role recovery, retaining the normal cooldown.
This does not automatically resubmit passwords if SDK authorization expires, and
does not create a replacement role. Resolve SDK challenges in the official client.

To deliberately force a fresh SDK/password attempt after SDK expiry, stop the
service, privately back up and remove the selected scope's `current.json` and
`initial-sdk.json`, then restart and issue a protected query. Removing only
`current.json` reuses `initial-sdk.json`; removing only the latter still loads the
saved game session. Never remove an entire shared state root or another account's
scope. A restart or SIGHUP explicitly rearms attempts; do not automate restarts
as a password-retry loop. Earlier snapshots are retained for operator management.

Manual `sdk-login`/`game-login` reject configurations with `[accounts]` to prevent
writing unrelated root-level state. Use a separate configuration without that
section for manual CLI operations. A changed password does not revoke a saved
game/SDK token or force password login by itself.

Structured logs contain safe events (`account_source`, `account_load`,
`account_sdk_login`, `account_initialization`) and error categories, never account
filenames, usernames, passwords or tokens. Status counters include both initial
loads and recovery attempts. `no_account` and `invalid_account_selection` distinguish
missing files from malformed/ambiguous sources. No list of accounts is exposed
over HTTP. See [security](../SECURITY.md) for deployment boundaries.
